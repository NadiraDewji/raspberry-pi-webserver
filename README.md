# raspberry-pi-webserver
I am using a raspberry-pi to create a web-server and this repository will include the steps I took to make it. 
A webserver can refer to either software or hardware or a combination of the two working in unison. A web server is a computer that stores a website's documents and data. This includes HTML files, images, videos, etc and sends them to a user's device. A server is connected to the internet and can be accessed using domain names. How the physical server is accessed is dependent on the software aspect of a sever like a HTTP server.

When a browser wants to load or retrieve a particular file hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP (software aspect). The request will then reach the pyhsical server, and the software server, HTTP, will send the document back and i tiwll get rendered on the page.  

Benefits of having your own web-server:
1. You can control your own data.
2. You don't have to pay for hosting-costs.
3. You'll get street credit. 
4. Educational resource.
